title: "angular 2 support"

This library heavily relies on the angular 1 $http service which is completely different from the angular 2 http service.

Therefore the library is currently not compatible to angular 2.

I've plans to port the library at some point, but currently I don't have time to do it.
Contributions for angular 2 compatibility are very welcome.
